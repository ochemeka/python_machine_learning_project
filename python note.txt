machine learning


Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.

Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).

Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

for example
imaging you are ask to write a program to identify images of cats,dogs, rabbit 
using traditional programming technique you make 
need to write rules alot of codes to look for edges curves colour pattern and all that, 
what if in the future you are given a new animal to identify and its a black and white image
you are going to have to rewrite all your rules again and that is very stressful

so with machine learning it is made easy

we build a model or an engine and gives it lots and lots of data can be tens of thousand
 of picture of images (i.e for cats and dogs or a rabbit)
our model will then find and learn patterns in the input data
#so if we gove is a new picture of a cat or a dog or a horse its going to tell us with 
certain level of accuracy #so the more data we input the more accuracy it will give us


machine learning has other applications such as
*self driving cars
*robotics
*language processing
*vision processing
*forecasting stock market trends /weather



machine learning projects involves a number of steps
1. import the data (ususally CSV file)
2. clean the data (remove bug:duplicates or incomplete)
if they are alphabet we need to convert them to numerica values 
else we get wrong results 
it depens on the kind of data we are working with 
3. split the data into two segment: (1)training (2)testing
#you can reserve 80% for taining and 20% for testing 

4.create a model
this involve selecting an algorithm to analyse our data
there are so different types of algorithm 
such as 
decision trace, neuronetwrk etc
each algorithm has its props and cons in terms of accuracy
and performance so the algorithm u choose depending on the 
problem you are trying to solve and ur input data

there are libraries that u can use out there that provide this 
algorithm  eg scikit-learn

5. train the model
so we feed it our training data our modell will look 
for partterns in the data

6.make prediction
we ask our model to make prediction #it may not be accurate as 
u start 
7. evaluate and improve
we eveluate the prediction and make sure they are accurate
then we need to get back to our model to either select another
algorithm that is going to produce a more better result for 
the kind of problem we are trying to solve or 
fine-tune the parameters of our model
each algorithm has parameters has we can modify to 
optimize the accuracy

Next is to look at the libraries and tool for machine learning

Libraries 
lets look at some popular libraries
1. Numpy- it provide multi-dimentional arrays
2. Pandas - it is a data analysis library, that provide 
a concept called data-frame
A data-frame is a two dimentional structure similar 
to an excel spreadsheet: so we have rows and columns
we can select data in a row or column or range of rows and column

3.MatPlotLib- it a two dimentional plotting library 
for creating graphs and plots

4.Scikit-Learn:- which is one of the most popular 
machine learning library that provide common algorithm such as 
decision-tree, neuro-netwrk and so on



we use jupital bcoz we frequently need to inspect the data and 
its very hard in vs code and terminals
